/**
 * The <code>AffineTransform</code> class represents a 2D affine transform
 * that performs a linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D
 * coordinates that preserves the "straightness" and
 * "parallelness" of lines.  Affine transformations can be constructed
 * using sequences of translations, scales, flips, rotations, and shears.
 * <p>
 * Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a 3 row by
 * 3 column matrix with an implied last row of [ 0 0 1 ].  This matrix
 * transforms source coordinates {@code (x,y)} into
 * destination coordinates {@code (x',y')} by considering
 * them to be a column vector and multiplying the coordinate vector
 * by the matrix according to the following process:
 * <pre>
 *      [ x']   [  m00  m01  m02  ] [ x ]   [ m00x + m01y + m02 ]
 *      [ y'] = [  m10  m11  m12  ] [ y ] = [ m10x + m11y + m12 ]
 *      [ 1 ]   [   0    0    1   ] [ 1 ]   [         1         ]
 * </pre>
 * In some variations of the <code>rotate</code> methods in the
 * <code>AffineTransform</code> class, a double-precision argument
 * specifies the angle of rotation in radians.
 * These methods have special handling for rotations of approximately
 * 90 degrees (including multiples such as 180, 270, and 360 degrees),
 * so that the common case of quadrant rotation is handled more
 * efficiently.
 * This special handling can cause angles very close to multiples of
 * 90 degrees to be treated as if they were exact multiples of
 * 90 degrees.
 * For small multiples of 90 degrees the range of angles treated
 * as a quadrant rotation is approximately 0.00000121 degrees wide.
 * This section explains why such special care is needed and how
 * it is implemented.
 * <p>
 * Since 90 degrees is represented as <code>PI/2</code> in radians,
 * and since PI is a transcendental (and therefore irrational) number,
 * it is not possible to exactly represent a multiple of 90 degrees as
 * an exact double precision value measured in radians.
 * As a result it is theoretically impossible to describe quadrant
 * rotations (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees) using these values.
 * Double precision floating point values can get very close to
 * non-zero multiples of <code>PI/2</code> but never close enough
 * for the sine or cosine to be exactly 0.0, 1.0 or -1.0.
 * The compiles of <code>Math.sin()</code> and
 * <code>Math.cos()</code> correspondingly never return 0.0
 * for any case other than <code>Math.sin(0.0)</code>.
 * These same compiles do, however, return exactly 1.0 and
 * -1.0 for some range of numbers around each multiple of 90
 * degrees since the correct answer is so close to 1.0 or -1.0 that
 * the double precision significand cannot represent the difference
 * as accurately as it can for numbers that are near 0.0.
 * <p>
 * The net result of these issues is that if the
 * <code>Math.sin()</code> and <code>Math.cos()</code> methods
 * are used to directly generate the values for the matrix modifications
 * during these radian-based rotation operations then the resulting
 * transform is never strictly classifiable as a quadrant rotation
 * even for a simple case like <code>rotate(Math.PI/2.0)</code>,
 * due to minor variations in the matrix caused by the non-0.0 values
 * obtained for the sine and cosine.
 * If these transforms are not classified as quadrant rotations then
 * subsequent code which attempts to optimize further operations based
 * upon the type of the transform will be relegated to its most general
 * compile.
 * <p>
 * Because quadrant rotations are fairly common,
 * this class should handle these cases reasonably quickly, both in
 * applying the rotations to the transform and in applying the resulting
 * transform to the coordinates.
 * To facilitate this optimal handling, the methods which take an angle
 * of rotation measured in radians attempt to detect angles that are
 * intended to be quadrant rotations and treat them as such.
 * These methods therefore treat an angle <em>theta</em> as a quadrant
 * rotation if either <code>Math.sin(<em>theta</em>)</code> or
 * <code>Math.cos(<em>theta</em>)</code> returns exactly 1.0 or -1.0.
 * As a rule of thumb, this property holds true for a range of
 * approximately 0.0000000211 radians (or 0.00000121 degrees) around
 * small multiples of <code>Math.PI/2.0</code>.
